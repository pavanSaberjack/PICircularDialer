PICircularDialer
================

This is simple app to show the old circular style telephone dialer. 

Currently it used to store the 4 digit numbers as a password,
and check it with the same for stored password. 

NOW Password is not stored in local defaults.

NOW We  save the password in KeyChain using PDKeychainBindingsController API
